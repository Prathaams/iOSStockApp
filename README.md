# Stock Lookup App

The **Stock Lookup App** is an iOS application built using **SwiftUI** and **Alpha Vantage API** integration. It allows users to search for stock symbols and view real-time stock data, including the current price, percentage change, and other financial details.

## Features

- **Search Stocks**: Users can search for stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) and get real-time data.
- **Glass UI**: The app features a modern glass-style user interface with a matte black background and metallic green accents.
- **Dynamic Search Bar**: The search bar is large, easy to use, and reloading occurs every 5 minutes to update stock data.
- **Stock Information**: Displays company name, current stock price, percentage change, open price, high/low prices, and volume.
- **Z-axis Card View**: Search results are displayed in a card-like structure with a 3D z-axis effect.

## API Integration

This app uses the **Alpha Vantage API** to fetch real-time stock data. You can sign up for a free API key on the [Alpha Vantage website](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

### Example API URL

https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY&symbol=SYMBOL&interval=1min&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-lookup-app.git
   cd stock-lookup-app

2. Open StockLookupApp.xcodeproj

3. Let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"

4. Build and run the app in Xcode.


##Usage

Enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple, TSLA for Tesla) in the search bar and press the search button.
View the stockâ€™s current price, percentage change, open, high, low, and volume information.
The data will automatically refresh every 5 minutes.

##Project Structure

ContentView.swift: The main view with the search bar and stock cards.
Stock.swift: Model for representing stock data.
StockViewModel.swift: Handles the business logic for fetching stock data from the API and parsing it.
StockAPIService.swift: Service responsible for making API requests to Alpha Vantage and handling the response.
GlassUIExtensions.swift: Custom UI components and extensions for creating the glass-effect UI.

##Requirements

iOS 14.0+
Xcode 12.0+
Swift 5.0+
Alpha Vantage API Key

##Architecture

This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to keep the code modular, clean, and maintainable.

Model: The Stock model represents the stock data fetched from the API.
ViewModel: The StockViewModel handles all business logic, including API calls and data processing.
View: The ContentView is responsible for rendering the UI components.

##Future Improvements

Add support for historical data and charting.
Improve error handling for invalid stock symbols and network failures.
Add unit tests for ViewModel and API service.

##Acknowledgments
